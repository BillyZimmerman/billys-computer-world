                      of experience in building websites. Through my full-time

            I am just getting started in my side business for building websites.
            I have 2+ years working for a company that host and maintains over
            1,000 shopify stores, I am fortunate to have this job and really
            appreciate the variety it provides. I have been building shops on
            Big Cartel, Wix and shopify for over 10 years now. I once had my own
            online store where I would sell merch and tickets for events. I am
            not a content writer or designer but I can help with some aspects of
            that if needed.

                Let's start with a free 15-minute consultation to see if we're a
                good match. I'll ask about your business, your goals, and who
                your customers are so we can figure out what your website needs
                most.

                to create a unique look that best represents your business. I'll
                get approval on all design elements before starting development
                to save you both time and money.

                Going live with your new site can be stressful. If you need

                or updates you might have. Post-launch support is optional but

              what you are looking for and from there we can decide if it makes
              sense to do business together or not.

                  Some businesses out there still don't have an online presence

                  establish your online presence.

                  Can offer the same service to build your site from the ground
                  up and offer support for the first 30 days after launch. This
                  is a great option if you are new to having a website and need
                  some help getting started.

                  Not all sites need a big overhaul. I can help with specific
                  small updates you may need, like improving user experience or
                  the overall look and feel. This is perfect if you're on a

                Through my day job, I get the opportunity to work on websites
                for major brands and bands from around the world. Depending on
                the project, I might build the entire site from start to finish,
                or I might focus on developing specific pages, features, or
                sections. To be transparent about what I do: I'm the developer
                who brings designs to life, but I'm not the one creating the
                designs or setting up the business side of things. I take the
                creative vision that's handed to me and make it work on the web.
                I don't own these sites, but I've contributed to building them
